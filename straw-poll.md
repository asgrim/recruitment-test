# Election Straw Poll

We would like you to build a demo web application that could be used alongside a live-streamed
election broadcast, to provide an unscientific straw-poll of the voting habits of the viewers.

The demo should allow users to specify their parliamentary (Westminster) constituency and enter
answers to the questions “Are you going to vote?” and “Who are you going to vote for?”. It
should display the results of these questions nationally and for each constituency.

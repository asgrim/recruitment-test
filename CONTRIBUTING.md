# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute recruitment tests for jobs you have applied for or your current
employer.

If you are going to contribute a test please ensure you remove any thing that could associate
with the company using the particular test.

Each recruitment test should be added in its own markdown file and a link added to the top of
the unordered list.

If you have not contributed to an open source project before have a read of this
[blog post](https://www.sammyk.me/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) on
contributing to open source projects on GitHub.

If you are not used to using git you could contribute a test by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/braddle/recruitment-test/issues) and labeling it 'contribution'

## Branching strategy

  - Always base your changes on the master branch (all new development happens here),
  - When you create Pull Request, always select master branch as target, otherwise it will be
    closed (this is selected by default).
